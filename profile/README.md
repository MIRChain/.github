#### Modular Interoperable Blockchain based on Ethereum/Quorum with multiple cryptographic standards and additional consensus mechanisms

### Features

- Different types of crypto standards can be chosen at a new chain initialization: 
  - GOST 34.10 (any 256 bit curve) + SteebogHash
  - CyptoProGOST + SteebogHash
  - NIST Secp256k1 + SHA3
- Differetnt consensus algoruthms are also avaliable at a new chain initialization:
  - Proof-of-Work
  - Proof-of-Authority 
  - Raft
  - iBFT
  - QBFT
