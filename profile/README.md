**Inspiration:** _Mir (Russian: Мир, IPA: [ˈmʲir]; lit. 'peace' or 'world') was the first **modular** space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996._

#### Modular blockchain system based on Ethereum/Quorum with multiple cryptographic standards

### Features

- Different types of crypto signature can be chosen at a new chain initialization: 
  - GOST 34.10 (any 256 bit curve)
  - CyptoProGOST
  - NIST Secp256k1
- Different type of hash function can be chosen at a new chain initialization:
  - SHA3
  - SteebogHash
- Differetnt consensus algoruthms are also avaliable at a new chain initialization:
  - Proof-of-Work
  - Proof-of-Authority 
  - Raft
  - iBFT
  - QBFT
